My nickname is sysc4lls and I love low level stuff including emulation, os internals, exploitation and reverse engineering

Around this blog you will find some writeups for ctfs and just random stuff I find interesting and want to write about.

Most of the things I will post on will be my first attempt on so take it with a grain of salt and have a fun reading!
